Project Overview

This project explores the global patterns of child deprivation using official UNICEF data.
Through interactive maps, bar charts, scatterplots, and time-series graphs, it highlights where and how children are denied access to basic needs like education, healthcare, and safe living conditions.

Dataset:
Source: UNICEF Indicator 1 and UNICEF Metadata
Coverage: Global countries across multiple years
Key Variables: Child deprivation (%), GDP per capita, birth rate, life expectancy

Technologies used:
Python (Pandas, Plotly, Plotnine)
Quarto for report generation
GitHub Pages for hosting

Insights:
Child deprivation remains widespread even in some middle-income countries.
Higher birth rates often correlate with greater deprivation.
GDP growth alone does not guarantee better child well-being.
Global progress has been uneven, with periods of improvement and stagnation.

Purpose:
This analysis aims to raise public awareness and inform policymakers about the urgent need to prioritise child well-being in development agendas.

The data used in this report is taken from UNICEF.
